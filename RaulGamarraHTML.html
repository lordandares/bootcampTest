    <h1>My Expectations</h1>
    <h2>Raul Gamarra</h2>
    <p>
        I expect to learn about the technologies that are used here in Jalasoft. How they work, what are they all about, when to use them,
        how to use them properly and improve my code quality and code writing with the tools they have. Mostly i expect to learn a lot about git
        and web development frameworks of wich i know little about.
